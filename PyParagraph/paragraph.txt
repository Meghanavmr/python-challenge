 Being a leader of a society, can mean many different things. It doesn’t always have to be guiding a group through land and sea, 
but it can also mean to be there to comfort someone when they need it the most. To start off, I think I am quite capable of being as leader, 
as my many peers think, as well as teachers, throughout the years. For instance, in my out of school communities/extracurriculars, 
I am part of the many leadership programs. To prove my claim, in my karate class(master peter's academy of martial arts, or MPAMA for short), 
Master Peter selected me to be in a special group for children that exhibited leadership qualities and demonstrated, being overall helpful and well rounded, 
to help out in class like junior instructors. Aside from that, I am very confident, and always ready to go the extra mile(sometimes literally) to help out. 
If I am chosen to be treasurer, then I will take everybody’s opinion, and try my best to participate at all times, and make our school a better place. 
As treasurer, I know that if I get the position, it is important to be responsible with my choice, as my teachers have signed, if you flip to the previous page. 
As you can see, I can be a good candidate, for running for treasurer, and I hope will be considered to run!
